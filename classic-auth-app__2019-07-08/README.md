# Classic Auth App

This is a React/Typescript client with a Typescript Express server that shows how to set up a basic client/server authentication flow. It was made on a Twitch livestream on [twitch.tv/biwills](https://twitch.tv/biwills) on 2019-07-08.

```ts
/** tonights TODO list:
 [x] create a login form
 [x] validate it with a simple server
 [x] split logged in and non-logged in users
*/
```
